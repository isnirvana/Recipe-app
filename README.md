## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of responsive design and modern web development techniques. Below are some highlights:

#### Code Snippets

Example of a semantic HTML structure:

```html
<body>
  <h1 class="heading">Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
</body>
```

Example of a CSS snippet for styling:

```css
body {
  margin: 3.5rem;
  padding: 0;
  font-size: 15px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Further mastering CSS Grid for complex layouts.
- Enhancing accessibility (ARIA roles and keyboard navigation).
- Exploring advanced animations using CSS and JavaScript.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Great resource for learning and troubleshooting CSS.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Comprehensive documentation for web technologies.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Helpful for feedback and insights.
